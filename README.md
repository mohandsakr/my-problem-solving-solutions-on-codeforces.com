# my-problem-solving-solutions-on-codeforces.com

It is the code and the link for the problems I have solved. I will update this often with my new solutions.

Note that it is not my coding style. The style may not be goodÂ because of the contest, and I am trying to solve this fast. You will find the link to the question in the comments of the code. Feel free to contact me at mohandsakr69@gmail.com. If you see an error, please let me know at mohandsakr69@gmail.com and follow my blog at https://mohandsakr.wordpress.com. for more solutions and explanations. Happy coding and good luck. Mohand sakr.
